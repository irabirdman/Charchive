# OC Wiki - Your Personal Character Encyclopedia

**A simple website where you can store and organize information about your original characters (OCs), their worlds, stories, and timelines.**

Think of it like Wikipedia, but just for your own characters! You can customize everything - the name, colors, and how it looks. Best of all, you can access it from anywhere once it's set up online.

---

## 🎯 What Can This Do?

- **Customize Everything**: Change the site name, colors, and how it looks to match your style
- **Private Admin Area**: A password-protected section where only you can add or edit content
- **Public Wiki Pages**: Beautiful pages that anyone can view (if you want to share your characters)
- **Organize by Worlds**: Group your characters into different worlds or universes
- **Create Timelines**: Track when events happen in your stories
- **Add Lore**: Write detailed background information about your worlds
- **See Statistics**: View how many characters, worlds, and entries you have

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup Guide

Follow these steps in order. Take your time - there's no rush!

### Step 1: Download the Project Files

**What you're doing**: Getting all the website files onto your computer.

1. Open a program called "Command Prompt" (Windows) or "Terminal" (Mac)
   - **Windows**: Press the Windows key, type "cmd", and press Enter
   - **Mac**: Press Cmd+Space, type "terminal", and press Enter

2. Navigate to where you want to save the project (like your Desktop):
   ```bash
   cd Desktop
   ```

3. Download the project (replace `<your-repo-url>` with the actual link to this project):
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```

4. Move into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd oc-wiki
   ```

**What you should see**: A new folder on your computer called "oc-wiki" with lots of files inside.

---

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

**What you're doing**: Downloading all the extra code pieces your website needs to work.

1. Make sure you're in the project folder (you should be from Step 1)

2. Run this command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**What you should see**: Lots of text scrolling by. This is normal! It's downloading everything you need. Wait until you see your command prompt again (it might take 1-5 minutes).

**If you get an error**: Make sure you installed Node.js correctly. Try typing `node --version` - if it shows a version number, you're good!

---

### Step 3: Set Up Your Site Information

**What you're doing**: Telling the website what to call itself and how to look.

1. Open the file called `site-config.json` in a text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac)

2. You'll see something like this:
   ```json
   {
     "websiteName": "My OC Wiki",
     "websiteDescription": "A place to store and organize information on original characters, worlds, lore, and timelines.",
     "iconUrl": "/icon.png",
     "siteUrl": "https://your-domain.com",
     "authorName": "Your Name",
     "shortName": "OC Wiki",
     "themeColor": "#8b5cf6",
     "backgroundColor": "#111827"
   }
   ```

3. Change the values to match your information:
   - `websiteName`: What you want your site to be called (e.g., "Sarah's Character Wiki")
   - `websiteDescription`: A short description of your site
   - `authorName`: Your name
   - `shortName`: A shorter version of your site name (for menus)
   - `themeColor`: A color code (like `#8b5cf6` for purple). You can find color codes at [htmlcolorcodes.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com)
   - `backgroundColor`: Another color code for the background
   - `siteUrl`: Leave this for now - you'll fill it in later when you deploy
   - `iconUrl`: Leave this as is unless you have a custom icon

4. Save the file

**Don't worry**: You can change all of this later through the website's admin panel!

---

### Step 4: Set Up Supabase (Your Database)

**What you're doing**: Creating an online storage space for all your character data.

#### 4a. Create a Supabase Account and Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and click "Start your project"
2. Sign up (you can use your email or GitHub account)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Fill in:
   - **Name**: Give your project a name (like "My OC Wiki Database")
   - **Database Password**: Create a strong password (write this down somewhere safe!)
   - **Region**: Pick the one closest to where you live
5. Click "Create new project"
6. Wait 1-2 minutes while it sets up (you'll see a loading screen)

#### 4b. Get Your Connection Keys

**What these are**: Special codes that let your website talk to your database. Think of them like passwords.

1. In your Supabase dashboard, click on **Settings** (the gear icon on the left)
2. Click **API** in the settings menu
3. You'll see three important things:
   - **Project URL**: A long web address (starts with `https://`)
   - **anon public key**: A long string of letters and numbers
   - **service_role key**: Another long string (this one is secret - don't share it!)

4. **Write these down** or keep this page open - you'll need them in the next step!

#### 4c. Set Up Your Database Tables

**What you're doing**: Creating the "folders" where your data will be stored.

1. In your Supabase dashboard, click **SQL Editor** on the left sidebar
2. Click **New query**
3. You need to run **all** migration files in order. Here's the complete list:
   - `20250101000000_create_site_settings.sql`
   - `20250101000001_create_admin_credentials.sql`
   - `20250101000002_create_worlds.sql`
   - `20250101000003_create_oc_identities.sql`
   - `20250101000004_create_ocs.sql`
   - `20250101000005_create_story_aliases.sql`
   - `20250101000006_create_world_story_data.sql`
   - `20250101000007_create_world_races.sql`
   - `20250101000008_create_timelines.sql`
   - `20250101000009_create_timeline_events.sql`
   - `20250101000010_create_timeline_event_timelines.sql`
   - `20250101000011_create_timeline_event_characters.sql`
   - `20250101000012_create_world_lore.sql`
   - `20250101000013_create_world_lore_ocs.sql`
   - `20250101000014_create_world_lore_timeline_events.sql`
   - `20250101000015_create_dropdown_options.sql`
   - `20250101000016_create_current_projects.sql`
   - `20250101000017_add_story_alias_fk_to_ocs.sql`

4. For each migration file (in order):
   - Open the file from the `supabase/migrations/` folder on your computer (you can open it in Notepad/TextEdit)
   - Copy ALL the text from that file
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor in Supabase
   - Click the **Run** button (or press Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter)
   - Wait for a green success message
   - Then move to the next file

**Important**: Run them in the exact order listed above! Each migration builds on the previous ones.

**If you see an error**: Make sure you copied the entire file, including all the text from top to bottom. Also verify you're running them in the correct order.

---

### Step 5: Set Up Your Environment Variables

**What you're doing**: Giving your website the secret codes it needs to connect to your database.

**What is an environment variable?**: It's like a secret note your website reads to know how to connect to things. We store these in a special file called `.env`.

1. In your project folder, find a file called `.env.example`
2. Copy this file and name the copy `.env` (remove the `.example` part)
   - **Windows**: Right-click, Copy, then Paste, then rename
   - **Mac**: Right-click, Duplicate, then rename

3. Open the `.env` file in a text editor

4. You'll see something like this:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_here
   ```

5. Replace each value with the ones you copied from Supabase:
   - Replace `your_supabase_project_url_here` with your **Project URL** from Step 4b
   - Replace `your_supabase_anon_key_here` with your **anon public key** from Step 4b
   - Replace `your_supabase_service_role_key_here` with your **service_role key** from Step 4b

6. Save the file

**Important**: Never share your `.env` file with anyone! It contains secret keys.

---

### Step 6: Test It Locally (On Your Computer)

**What you're doing**: Making sure everything works before putting it online.

1. Make sure you're in the project folder in your command prompt/terminal

2. Run this command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Wait until you see a message like "Ready on http://localhost:3000"

4. Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

**What you should see**: Your website! It might look basic at first - that's okay.

---

### Step 7: Complete the Initial Setup

**What you're doing**: Setting up your admin account so you can log in and add content.

1. In your browser, go to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/setup`

2. You'll see a setup form. Fill it out with:
   - Your site name and description
   - An admin username (this is what you'll use to log in)
   - An admin password (make it strong!)

3. Click "Complete Setup"

4. You'll be taken to a login page at `/admin/login`

5. Log in with the username and password you just created

**Congratulations!** Your website is now set up and running on your computer!

---

## 🚂 Putting Your Website Online (Deployment)

**What you're doing**: Making your website accessible to anyone on the internet (or just keeping it private - it's up to you).

### Step 1: Create a Railway Account

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Sign up with your GitHub account (this connects Railway to your GitHub)
4. Verify your email if asked

### Step 2: Connect Your Project to Railway

1. In Railway, click **"New Project"**
2. Click **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. If asked, authorize Railway to access your GitHub
4. Find and select your OC Wiki repository
5. Railway will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project (this is good!)

### Step 3: Add Your Secret Keys to Railway

**What you're doing**: Giving Railway the same secret codes you put in your `.env` file.

1. In your Railway project, click the **Variables** tab
2. Click **"New Variable"** for each of these:

   - **Variable name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
     **Value**: Your Supabase Project URL (from earlier)

   - **Variable name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     **Value**: Your Supabase anon key (from earlier)

   - **Variable name**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
     **Value**: Your Supabase service_role key (from earlier)

   - **Variable name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
     **Value**: Leave this blank for now - Railway will give you a URL later

   - **Variable name**: `NODE_ENV`
     **Value**: `production`

3. Save all the variables

### Step 4: Deploy Your Website

1. Railway will automatically start building your website
2. Wait for the build to finish (you'll see a progress bar)
3. Once it's done, Railway will give you a web address (like `your-site.railway.app`)
4. Copy that address and update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` variable in Railway with the full address (include `https://`)

**Your website is now live!** Share the Railway URL with anyone you want to see it.

## 👥 Sharing Code Updates (For Project Maintainers)

**What this section is for**: If you're the person making changes to the code and want others to be able to use your updates, this is for you!

**What you're doing**: Uploading your changes to GitHub so others can download them.

### How to Share Your Updates

**Before you start**: Make sure you have a GitHub account and your project is already on GitHub (if you deployed to Railway, it should already be there).

#### Step 1: Make Your Changes

1. Edit any files you want to update (using your code editor)
2. Save all your changes

#### Step 2: Check What Changed

**What you're doing**: Seeing what files you modified.

1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac)
2. Navigate to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/oc-wiki
   ```
   (Replace `path/to/oc-wiki` with the actual path to your project)

3. Check what files changed:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

**What you should see**: A list of files you've changed (they'll be in red or green)

#### Step 3: Tell Git About Your Changes

**What you're doing**: Marking which files you want to upload.

1. Add all your changed files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   (The `.` means "all files")

   **OR** if you only want to add specific files:
   ```bash
   git add filename1.js filename2.tsx
   ```
   (Replace with your actual file names)

#### Step 4: Save Your Changes (Commit)

**What you're doing**: Creating a "snapshot" of your changes with a message describing what you did.

1. Create a commit with a message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of what you changed"
   ```

   **Examples of good commit messages**:
   - `"Fixed the character display bug"`
   - `"Added new timeline feature"`
   - `"Updated the README with better instructions"`
   - `"Changed the site colors to purple"`

#### Step 5: Upload to GitHub (Push)

**What you're doing**: Sending your changes to GitHub so others can see them.

1. Upload your changes:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

2. If this is your first time, you might need to set the remote:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   (Or `master` instead of `main` if that's what your branch is called)

**What you should see**: Messages showing your files being uploaded. When it says "done" or shows a success message, you're finished!

**If you get an error about authentication**: You might need to set up GitHub authentication. See the troubleshooting section below.

#### Step 6: Tell Others About the Update

Let your team know that you've pushed updates! They can now follow the instructions below to get your changes.

---

## 📥 Getting Updates from Others (For Team Members)

**What this section is for**: If someone else made changes and you want to get the latest version of the code.

**What you're doing**: Downloading the newest changes from GitHub to your computer.

### How to Get the Latest Updates

#### Step 1: Make Sure You're in the Project Folder

1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac)
2. Navigate to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/oc-wiki
   ```
   (Replace `path/to/oc-wiki` with the actual path to your project)

#### Step 2: Save Your Current Work (Optional but Recommended)

**What you're doing**: Making sure you don't lose any changes you made.

**Important**: If you've made changes to files, you should either:
- **Option A**: Commit and push your changes first (follow the "Sharing Code Updates" section above)
- **Option B**: Stash your changes (temporarily save them):
  ```bash
  git stash
  ```
  (You can get them back later with `git stash pop`)

#### Step 3: Download the Latest Updates

**What you're doing**: Getting all the new changes from GitHub.

1. Download the updates:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

**What you should see**: Messages showing files being downloaded and updated. If there are conflicts (see below), Git will tell you.

#### Step 4: Install Any New Packages (If Needed)

**What you're doing**: If the update added new features, you might need new code packages.

1. Install new packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**When to do this**: If the person who updated the code added new features or dependencies, you'll need to run this.

#### Step 5: Restart Your Development Server

**What you're doing**: Making sure your local website uses the new code.

1. If your development server is running, stop it (press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
2. Start it again:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

**You're done!** Your local version now has all the latest updates.

---

## 🔄 Handling Conflicts (When Changes Overlap)

**What this means**: Sometimes you and someone else changed the same file. Git needs you to decide which version to keep.

### If You Get a Merge Conflict

**What you'll see**: Git will tell you there's a conflict and which files have conflicts.

1. Open the files that have conflicts (Git will mark them with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`)

2. You'll see something like this:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Your version of the code
   =======
   Their version of the code
   >>>>>>> branch-name
   ```

3. **Decide what to keep**:
   - Keep your version? Delete their section (everything between `=======` and `>>>>>>>`)
   - Keep their version? Delete your section (everything between `<<<<<<<` and `=======`)
   - Keep both? Edit the code to combine them, then remove the conflict markers

4. Save the file

5. Tell Git you fixed it:
   ```bash
   git add filename.js
   ```
   (Replace with the actual filename)

6. Complete the merge:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
   ```

**If this seems complicated**: Ask the person who made the changes to help you resolve it, or just keep their version if you're not sure.

---

## 🔐 Setting Up GitHub Authentication (If Needed)

**When you need this**: If `git push` or `git pull` asks for a username and password.

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2. Click your profile picture → **Settings**
3. Scroll down and click **Developer settings**
4. Click **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**
5. Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**
6. Give it a name (like "OC Wiki Project")
7. Check the box for **repo** (this gives access to repositories)
8. Click **Generate token**
9. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)
10. When Git asks for a password, paste the token instead

### Option 2: GitHub Desktop (Easier for Beginners)

1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Use GitHub Desktop instead of the command line - it's much easier!

---

## 💡 Tips for Working Together

- **Communicate**: Let others know when you're pushing updates
- **Pull before you push**: Always run `git pull` before making changes to make sure you have the latest code
- **Write clear commit messages**: Describe what you changed so others understand
- **Test your changes**: Make sure your code works before pushing it
- **Don't push your `.env` file**: It contains secrets! (It should already be in `.gitignore`)

---

## ⚙️ Understanding the Configuration Files

Don't worry - you don't need to understand code to use these! Here's what each file does in simple terms:

### `site-config.json`
**What it is**: A file that stores your site's basic information (name, colors, etc.)

**When to edit it**: When you want to change how your site looks or what it's called

**How to edit**: Open it in any text editor, change the values, save it

### `.env` file
**What it is**: A file with secret connection codes (like passwords)

**When to edit it**: Only when setting up or if you change your Supabase project

**Important**: Never share this file or put it online!

### `supabase/migrations/` folder
**What it is**: Files that set up your database structure

**When to use it**: Only once, when first setting up (you already did this in Step 4c)

---

## 🔧 Using the Admin Panel

Once you're logged in, you can:

- **Site Settings** (`/admin/settings`): Change your site name, colors, and description
- **Add Worlds**: Create different universes for your characters
- **Add Characters**: Create character profiles with all their information
- **Create Timelines**: Track when events happen in your stories
- **Add Lore**: Write background information about your worlds
- **View Statistics**: See how many entries you have

Everything is done through easy-to-use forms - no coding required!

---
